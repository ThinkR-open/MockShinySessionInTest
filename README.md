# testServer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of testServer is to show how to overwrite the MockShinySession
object while testing. See the testing results in the [Github Actions
tab](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/MockShinySessionInTest/actions).

This repo serves as an example for [this
blogpost](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/setting-values-in-r6-classes-and-testing-shinymockshinysession/).
